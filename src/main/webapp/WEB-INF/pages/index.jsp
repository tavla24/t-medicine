                <h5>Psychiatric symptoms may indicate the beginning of Alzheimer’s disease</h5>
                <div class="texcon">
                    Researchers at UC San Francisco (UCSF) and the University of São Paulo have shown that the earliest
                    stages of Alzheimer’s brain pathology are tightly linked to neuropsychiatric symptoms such as
                    anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances.
                </div>
                <div class="texcon">
                    The finding strongly suggests that rather than such symptoms causing Alzheimer’s to develop, they
                    are in fact the earliest warning signs that the disease is already in progress.
                </div>
                <div class="texcon">
                    Study author Lea Grinberg says the discovery that the biological basis for these symptoms is the
                    early Alzheimer’s pathology itself was quite surprising: “It suggests these people with
                    neuropsychiatric symptoms are not at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease – they already have it.”
                </div>
                <div class="texcon">
                    The authors say the findings could lead to earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer’s and to biomarkers that
                    could be used to develop drugs that would slow disease progression. They could also help researchers
                    better understand the biological basis of psychiatric symptoms in older individuals.

                <h5>Identifying Biomarkers for Guillain–Barré Syndrome</h5>
                <div class="texcon">
                    Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare autoimmune condition in which the immune system attacks peripheral
                    nerves and damages the myelin insulation. Symptoms rapidly progress from pain to muscle weakness and
                    even paralysis. Although Guillain-Barre usually affects the hands, feet, and limbs, it can be
                    life-threatening when nerves controlling breathing are affected.
                </div>
                <div class="texcon">
                    Guillain-Barre syndrome has been clinically sub-classified into several variants1, but specific
                    biomarkers for each of the subtypes have not been well defined. Furthermore, there are several other
                    conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as inflammatory demyelination disorders of the
                    central nervous system (IDDs).
                </div>
                <div class="texcon">
                    Consequently, Guillain-Barre syndrome can be difficult to diagnose, especially in younger patients2.
                    This can be seriously detrimental to patient outcomes since early effective treatment is critical to
                    preventing rapid progression to a severe clinical course.
                </div>
                <div class="texcon">
                    Greater understanding of the underlying pathology of Guillain-Barre syndrome is thus needed to
                    facilitate its accurate diagnosis and improve patient prognoses3.

                <h5>What is the Role of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor?</h5>
                <div class="texcon">
                    Formation of new blood vessels can be divided into two processes – vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.
                    Vasculogenesis represents the formation of new blood vessels from hemangioblasts during embryonic
                    development, while angiogenesis is the formation of new capillary branches from established blood
                    vessels.
                </div>
                <div class="texcon">
                    Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, abbreviated as VEGF, represents a protein signaling molecule
                    which plays a crucial role in both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.

                    There are five different types of VEGF - VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and placental growth factor
                    (PlGF).
                </div>
                <div class="texcon">
                    VEGF-A, sometimes referred to as VEGF, was discovered in the 1980s by various groups of researchers.
                    VEGF-A is a single gene, but it is one of the VEGF proteins which exists in sub-types; this occurs
                    due to the way its messenger RNA (mRNA) is processed, and in the case of VEGF-A this gives rise to
                    nine sub-types.
                </div>
                <div class="texcon">
                    This protein is a “mitogen”, necessary for the survival of vascular endothelial cells. VEGF-A,
                    expressed in many organs and tissues, also allows plasma and proteins contained within the plasma to
                    pass through the endothelial layer of blood vessels without damaging the vessel. Mice lacking VEGF-A
                    do not survive, and exhibit abnormal vasculature; therefore, it is likely that VEGF-A is essential
                    for the formation of blood vessels at early stages of embryonic development.

                <h5>Does the Microbiome Interact with the Human Endocrine System?</h5>
                <div class="texcon">
                    Whilst the effect of the microbiome on the digestive system has been studied over the past decade,
                    the understanding of its effect on the endocrine system is less well understood.
                </div>
                <div class="texcon">
                    The endocrine system synthesizes and secrete hormones to regulate physiological processes.
                    Interestingly the gut microbiome is an endocrine organ itself; metabolomic and metagenomic studies
                    have revealed bacterial metabolites and components that affect organ function and subsequently,
                    physiological outcomes. Bacterial- derived metabolites and components may act locally with the host,
                    activating cell receptors or neural terminations, as well as distally through circulatory
                    dissemination. Their mechanism of action is varied- paracrine, endocrine and nervous - yet all
                    converge on influencing endocrine function.

                <div class="texcon">
                    The human gastrointestinal system is unable to digest all carbohydrates. Typically, these
                    indigestible carbohydrates are referred to as dietary fiber, and reach the gut microbiota in the
                    lower GI tract where they are subject to enzymic breakdown. This yields several classes of
                    compounds, the most well studied of which, are the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The impact of
                    SCFAs on human health is very well documented in the literature; they act both locally and in an
                    endocrine manner, reaching distal sites such as the liver, adipose tissue, muscle and brain.
                    Subsequently their physiological effects are wildly variable, effecting energy regulation,
                    inflammation and the modulation of cancer.
                </div>
                <div class="texcon">
                    Beginning with the digestive system, studies have demonstrated that changes in gut peptide
                    production can occur following modification of dietary fiber intake or gut microbiome modification.
                    For example, studies have implicated nondigestible carbohydrate intake in gut microbiome modulation
                    to increase satiety and reduce food intake to reduce energy intake. Oligofructose-induced modulation
                    of the gut microbiome produces this effect and were noncommittal with higher blood GLP-1 and PYY
                    levels, key anti-obesity regulators.

                <div class="texcon">
                    Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects an increasing number of people worldwide,
                    with an estimated 6.1 million children were living with ADHD in 2016, according to the National
                    Survey of Children’s Health.

                <div class="texcon">
                    Now, MRI scans have revealed that children taking the common medication methylphenidate experience
                    alterations in the distribution of white matter in the brain. This has led to the researchers
                    warning doctors not to over-prescribe the medication and only use it when it is absolutely
                    necessary, as the long-term effects of the medication are not yet known.

                <div class="texcon">
                    Methylphenidate is a stimulant medication commonly prescribed for ADHD and works by blocking
                    norepinephrine and dopamine transporters. Deficits in the prefrontal cortex are associated with ADHD
                    symptoms, and increased dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the prefrontal cortex may have
                    beneficial effects on the condition.

                    The effects of methylphenidate on white matter, and by extension brain development, is not fully
